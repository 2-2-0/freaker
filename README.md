a binaural pulses generation tool for neuroinduction

use with care, and only if you know what you are doing!


lower the volume of your stereo headphones down to 0.
set the upper dials to the carrier frequency (ex. 108)
set the lower dials to the desired binaural pulse (ex. 6.5)
push the "execute BTS" to get tones.
turn the volume up until you can listen clearly and comfy.
